# Contributing to Tragic Methods

## Where to place your scripts

There is a directory for programming each language in the root of this project.
If there is no directory for you programming language, feel free to create one.

Every script should be placed in its own subdirectory. If you're going to create a script
called foo-bar.js you should place it under `/js/foo-bar/foo-bar.js`.

## Document your scripts

Because we want to make people aware of the language quirks used in these examples
we require scripts to be document so we can actually learn what is going on.
Scripts without documentation will not be merged.
